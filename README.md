# DHCP-Log-Analysis-Splunk

Overview

This project uses Splunk to analyze DHCP logs from the MACCDC2012 dataset to gain insights from the logs. The dataset, dhcp.log.gz (1 MB), contains DHCP transactions with events, capturing IP assignments and device activity. Itâ€™s designed to help SOC analysts identify and analyze dhcp logs so as to be skilled at differentiating between normal behaviour and possible abnormal ones

Goals

-Identify and analyze DHCP logs to gain deep insights using Splunk queries.
-Build skills in crafting queries to analyze DHCP log fields 
-Document findings with clear explanations, queries, and visualizations.


Steps

1. Download dhcp.log.gz from securitydatasets.com and extract to dhcp.log.
2. Upload dhcp.log to Splunk Cloud 
3. Verify data with the splunk index.
4. Run splunk proccessing language queries to gain insights from the DHCP logs
5. Create dashboards to visualize patterns 
6. Document findings in docs/ with queries and screenshots.
7. Save results and images in screenshots/ and update GitHub repo.
8. Compile a report with insights and recommendations.


Requirements

Splunk Cloud for log analysis

7-Zip to extract dhcp.log.gz.

dhcp.log (1 MB) with extracted fields.

GitHub repo for storing docs and screenshots.
