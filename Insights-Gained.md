This splunk query shows every deviceâ€™s MAC address, requested IP address, assigned IP address, lease duration and timestamp. It provides us with a full picture of DHCP activity

-  Top Devices by Request Count

This identifies the device with the most request by counting how many times each MAC requests an IP, further highlighting potentially busy or misconfigured devices

Failed IP Assignments with Duration=0

This lists devices failing to get an IP lease, pointing to network errors or potential probing.


Successful IP Assignments with Duration>0

This shows devices successfully assigned IPs with their lease durations that is 86400 seconds = 24 hours, indicating normal network behavior.

Broadcast Requests

This Identifies devices sending DHCP discovery requests and it's usefulness can be found in understanding network join attempts or spotting excessive scans.

Request Frequency Over Time

This tracks how often devices request IPs in 10-minute windows, highlighting spikes that could indicate abnormal activity.

DHCP Server Interactions to specific DHCP server
