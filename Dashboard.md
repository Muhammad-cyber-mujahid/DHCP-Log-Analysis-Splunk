The dashboard gives us a visual view of the insights derived from the DHCP log

- Top Devices by Request Count

This shows the top 5 devices making the most IP requests, so you can spot which ones are the busiest or potentially misbehaving

Request Frequency Over Time

Tracks how often devices request IPs over time, so you can spot spikes that might indicate a problem (like a device flooding the server).

Broadcast Requests

Highlights devices sending broadcast requests to find the DHCP server, which is normal but could be excessive in odd cases

DHCP Server Interactions to specific DHCP server

This shows how devices interact with a DHCP server (192.168.202.1), revealing server load and lease patterns.
